# OpenCV_Project
 9/2021 Open CV Project to demonstrate understanding of OpenCV textbook

## Description
Animation with superhero --> rotates, gets bigger, add wings with bitwise operation, crop so that no background 
tell story with images
Use histogram as measure of color or power??? 
Counting bad guys or fire balls

1. Start off with Groot (crop and mask)
2. Turns into the Hulk to battle bad guys (resize and transform)
3. Count bad guys (detection, contours) 
4. Grows wings and flys around (bitwise, rotate, transform)
5. Turns into iron man and shoots fireballs at monster (crop and bitwise)
6. Use histogram to measure power
7. Count fireballs (detection, countours)
8. Show fireballs into color channel images
9. monster turns into canny noodle drawing
10. Draw happy face!


## Chapter Roadmap
3. Loading, Displaying, and Saving -- DONE
4. Image Basics (Accessing and Manipulating Pixels) -- DONE
5. Drawing (Lines, Rectangles, Circles)
6. Image Processing (Transformations, Arithmetic, Bitwise Operations, Masking, Splitting & Merging Channels, Color Spaces) -- DONE
7. Histograms (Grayscale, Color, Equalization, with Masks)
8. Smoothing & Blurring (Averaging, Gaussian, Median, Bilateral)
9. Thresholding (Simple, Adaptive, Otsu and Riddler-Calvard) -- DONE
10. Gradients & Edge Detection (Laplacian and Sobel, Canny Edge Detector)
11. Countours (Counting Coins, Contours)
