Animation with superhero --> rotates, gets bigger, add wings with bitwise operation, crop so that no background 
tell story with images
Use histogram as measure of color or power??? 
Counting bad guys or fire balls

1. Start off with Groot (crop and mask)
2. Turns into the Hulk to battle bad guys (resize and transform)
3. Count bad guys (detection, contours) 
4. Grows wings and flys around (bitwise, rotate, transform)
5. Turns into iron man and shoots fireballs at monster (crop and bitwise)
6. Use histogram to measure power
7. Count fireballs (detection, countours)
8. Show fireballs into color channel images
9. monster turns into canny noodle drawing
10. Draw happy face!
